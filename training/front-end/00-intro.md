# Introduction to front-end programming

## Goal of this training

This training was developed for back-end and infra developers.

I am not an expert in front-end development. This should only be considered an introduction.

## Prerequisites

Assumed knowledge:

- HTTP
- Basics about browser
- Basic about HTML/CSS/JS

## To do before the course

Read the [grab/front-end-guide](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide) to get a 10,000 viewpoint about the road ahead. Evidently you don't need to check the details about each topic (that's what we'll do in this course), but obviously feel free to look up what seems interesting to you!

## Curriculum

1. Modern Javascript/TypeScript development
2. Intro to React
