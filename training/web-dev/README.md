# Learning web development

## Goal of this training

This training provides an opinionated ramp-up program for web developers.

## Prerequisites

Not much, just general knowledge about computer and the Internet.

## Principles

- Focus on the main stuff. A lot of things have to be learnt on the job anyway.
- For aspiring professionals. Programming is not only about raw knowledge,
  it's also about best practices.
- Go wide.
- We learn by doing, so this training includes lots of exercises.
- A lot of videos are included, since they provide hands-on experiences.

## Roadmap

1. Start with a programming language.
2. Do a first pass at the web development components: DB, HTTP API, etc.
3. Write a full-fledged exercise, get it reviewed.
4. Go deeper in the topics above.

## Meta: learning about learning

Feel free to checkout some of the articles about [Learning and memorizing](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming#learning--memorizing)

## Topics

### Pick a powerful text editor and learn its ins and outs

VSCode is a strong pick nowadays (I use and obviously prefer Vim :).

Make sure to spend a lot of time in your text editor, watch tutorials about
advanced features, install extensions, learn all the main keyboard shortcuts,
subscribe to mailing lists about it, etc.

You will spend most of your time within your text editor. Turn it into your
ally!

### Learn the ins and outs of a programming language

A developer's main tool being the programming language, it is important to
achieve high proficiency in at least one of them.

I'd recommend starting with Python or TypeScript.

For Python, you can have a look at my repo [charlax/python-education](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

To ensure you have good command of the language, you should try out some of
those exercises:

- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) (get free code reviews!)
- [Small Python exercises](https://github.com/charlax/python-education/tree/master/learning-python/exercises)
- [danistefanovic/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) (for instance: build a [git in Python](https://wyag.thb.lt/))
- [Other list of exercises](https://github.com/charlax/python-education#exercises)

Learn how to handle:

- Regexes
    - Do exercises
- Functional programming
    - [Functional Programming Fundamentals](https://www.matthewgerstman.com/tech/functional-programming-fundamentals/)
- Design in patterns
    - E.g. [in Python](https://medium.com/@daniel.heller/ten-principles-for-growth-69015e08c35b))
- Tests
    - [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all)
- Crazy things in languages
    - ðŸŽž [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

If you have time, learn more programming languages, starting with some that are
*very* different from your main one:

- Haskell
- Clojure
- Kotlin
- Rust
- Assembly

### Learn the topics of web development

Note: this is just a short selection of stuff listed in
[charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming).

Start your career the right way with this article: [Ten Principles for Growth as an Engineer](https://medium.com/@daniel.heller/ten-principles-for-growth-69015e08c35b)
